Users should be able to export RRID in their database the same way they are dealing with their literature reference (see zotero plugin REF): With one click, the reagent should be added to a list and labelled with user-given information.

This could be linked to the purchase itself, as the elements could be saved in a basket that would be sent to the lab manager to be ordered.

It would be easier to use once the inventory function are in place, on the other hand, the process should be based on open standards and API, such that it could talk to existing lab management and ordering software
